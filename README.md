# Unofficial Duckduckgo API

This is an unofficial Duckduckgo API created to grab the first 25 results queried from <duckduckgo.com>. The website <duckduckgo.com> does provide an api, however I found the endpoints to be overly complex (for my taste), and I didn't like the results. So, now we are here... I rolled my own unofficial Duckduckgo API for easy utilization in a Java based project. Just make sure rocking maven in project, and you're in our little club :wink:
